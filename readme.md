#LEARN FLASK VIA THIS PROJECT.
FLASK:a popular, lightweight Python web framework that provides the essential tools to build web applications and APIs.
-The project entails a POS system called MY DUKA.
-run the terminal on VSCODE and type pip install flask
-after running,"pip install flask"
-install pip install psycopg2-binary
-After installing the above packages
-have the files:database.py,main.py
-Open sqlpowershell to open ur database.
-Create a new database in sql shell called myduka_db

1.create database myduka_db; 2.connect to myduka_db database \c myduka_db 3.Run the following commands to create tables
 //products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    buying_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (buying_price >= 0),
    selling_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (selling_price >= 0)
);

//stock table
CREATE TABLE stock (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

//sales table
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

                              WEBSERVER
//  WEBSERVER:A web server is a combination of computer hardware and software that stores website files (HTML, CSS, images, JS) and delivers them to users via a browser using HTTP/HTTPS. It acts as a digital librarian, receiving, processing, and responding to client requests to display website content.

                              WEB HOSTING
//WEB HOSTING:Web hosting is a service that provides secure, internet-connected server space to store website files (HTML, CSS, images, data), making them accessible to users worldwide 24/7. It acts as the "home" for a website, allowing browsers to request and display site content instantly. Hosting providers handle server maintenance, security, and uptime.(Renting a server to deploy resources and make them available to the internet)

                              I.P ADDRESS
//I.P ADDRESS:An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It acts as a digital identifier or "mailing address" for computers, phones, and IoT devices, allowing them to send/receive data, locate each other, and communicate over local networks or the internet.(A unique number that identifies a number or a network.)(A unique number that identifies a device on the internet.)

                            DOMAIN NAME
//DOMAIN NAME:A domain name is the unique, human-friendly address used to locate a website on the internet, acting as an easy-to-remember alias for a complex numerical IP address. Examples include google.com or wikipedia.org, which users type into browsers to reach specific web servers.(Human friendly name for us to access an ip address.)

                            U.R.L
//URL:A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the unique, web-based address for a specific resource on the internet, such as a website, image, or file. Acting like a digital, functional address, it tells a browser how to locate and display information.
- It typically consists of a protocol (e.g., https), a domain name (e.g., example.com), and a file path(specific resource u want to access),port(where a service is running). (Full address of a resource on the internet.)

                           HTTP/HTTPS
//HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are protocols for transmitting data between a web browser and a server. HTTP sends data in plain text, leaving it vulnerable to interception, whereas HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure data, providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
- HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive user information and boosts SEO.

                       **INTRODUCTION TO PSYCOPG2.**
-Simply a POSTGRESQL driver or adapter used to connect python to a POSTGRES database.
-It needs to know the SERVER,DATABSE,PORT,USERNAME AND PASSWORD.
-python is connected to a POSTGRES database by psycopg2,using the function:#psycopg2.connect()
1.HOST:on what server is the database hosted.
- local host:my local device(laptop or computer),it uses 127.0.0.1
2.PORT:exactly where the Postgres service is running on my server.
-5432 is the default port for the POSTGRES SERVICE
3.USER:username used to authenticate or identify who is accessing your database.
4.PASSWORD:The password attached to the username,to authenticate oneself before using POSTGRES services.
4.DB NAME:what database are u connecting to.
**cur**:an object used to perform database operations.
it performs the following:CRUD operations(create,Read,Update,Delete data)

DB OPERATIONS
-insert two products in SQLSHELL.

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

We have the follwing broad categories of data types in Python:

1.Inbuilt data types - data types that come with the programming language

int, float, str , lists, bool 2.User defined data types - created by the programmer
enabled by the use of classes and objects
OOP - a paradigm that builds programs around classes and objects Class - a blueprint for creating objects Objects - an instance of a class

Any class has 2 things: 1.Data - attributes - variables holding data in a class - answers the question , what does a class have? - e.g. class Person -> name, age, email, dob, address class car - make , yom , model

2.Behaviour - defined by methods - Method - a function inside a class - Behaviour answers the question, what can a class do? - e.g class Person - walk , talk, eat ,sleep , code class Car - start , move ,stop

*Constructor - a special method used to initialze objects - it is automatically called when an object is created - init() self - refers to the object being created
